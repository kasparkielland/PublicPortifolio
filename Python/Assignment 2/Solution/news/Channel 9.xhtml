Flori has taken his bullying case against his former employer to the Court of Appeal.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Queensland judge&#x27;s ruling that officers engaging in oral sex in a police car is not &quot;official misconduct&quot; could deter public servants from blowing the whistle on their colleagues, a court has heard.</p><p>Police whistleblower Rick Flori is appealing a Brisbane Supreme Court ruling in his bullying case against his former employer that meant he was not afforded public interest disclosure protection after complaining about sexual conduct between two officers.</p><p>The former Gold Coast sergeant claimed he suffered reprisal after sending a letter to the then-Crime and Misconduct Commission alleging, in late 2009, a female police officer performed a sex act on a male colleague in a police car at a Red Rooster car park.</p><p>In the letter, Mr Flori expresses concern about &quot;special attention&quot; given to the female officer.</p><p>&quot;I can see the headline: Senior police officer receives fellatio in police car,&quot; he wrote in February 2010.</p><p>Mr Flori has argued he should have been protected under the then-Whistleblowers Protection Act, which states a public officer may make a public interest disclosure about someone else&#x27;s conduct if it is &quot;official misconduct&quot;.</p><p>He is suing three officers and the Queensland government for reprisal.</p><img data-id="18eb53aa-ecf0-4760-899b-3a2914ae0675" src="https://prod.static9.net.au/fs/18eb53aa-ecf0-4760-899b-3a2914ae0675" caption="Rick Flori arrives to the

not afforded whistleblower protection so his case regarding the letter cannot proceed.</p><p>&quot;Such conduct may amount to &#x27;police misconduct&#x27;,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;The fact they are sitting in a police car, and using the car for a reason unrelated to their professional duties at the time of the sexual act, is not sufficient, in my view, to raise &#x27;misconduct&#x27; to the level of &#x27;official misconduct&#x27;.&quot;</p><p>Mr Flori has taken his case to the Court of Appeal, where his barrister Gavin Rebetzke asked the three judges to &quot;reflect on the position of a public servant or police officer faced with the dilemma of whether to report wrong-doing&quot;.</p><p>He said the aim of the whistleblower legislation was to encourage people to speak up &quot;without fear that they would be targeted with reprisal action&quot;.</p><p>&quot;How can that public servant or police officer of integrity derive any confidence that they should chose to report wrong-doing and, in doing so, receive the protection of the law?&quot; Mr Rebetzke said on Thursday.</p><p>He said even if the officers&#x27; sex act didn&#x27;t amount to official misconduct, Mr Flori reasonably and honestly believed it did and should have been protected.</p><p>Mr Flori quit the force before being acquitted by a jury of misconduct last year after leaking footage of police bashing a handcuffed man in a police station basement in 2012.</p><p>Prosecutors alleged he leaked the footage as part of a vendetta against Senior Sergeant David Joachim, an officer involved in the arrest who was also promoted ahead of him.</p>]]></content:encoded><pubDate>Thu, 17 Oct 2019 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>9News</author><guid

of despair.</p><p>Karen runs 3200 merino and poll merino sheep on Wattle Downs, west of Tara. What once was lush with grass and a running creek, is now a dustbowl. It hasn&#x27;t had a decent season since 2013. In the past two years they&#x27;ve had just four millimetres of rain. That means the sheep need to be fed by hand.</p><img data-id="43c46a7d-d7c6-4483-a2fb-26d21fb49c04" src="https://prod.static9.net.au/fs/43c46a7d-d7c6-4483-a2fb-26d21fb49c04" caption="Melissa Downes speaks with farmer Karen Huskisson." alt="" source="9News"  data-width="1280" data-height="720" fs="true" master-key="43c46a7d-d7c6-4483-a2fb-26d21fb49c04"/><p>&quot;Every morning you get up, you put your big girl pants on and you just keep going because there&#x27;s animals out there that need you,&quot; Karen says.</p><p>&quot;I start at four and probably finish at half past eight, between half past eight and 10 at night.&quot;</p><p>That&#x27;s day in, day out - no flexitime, no days off, no weekends or annual leave. It&#x27;s a relentless cycle with no sign of ending anytime soon.</p><p>And it&#x27;s not just the physical demands.</p><p>&quot;When we started really feeding this year we were working on about $5000 a week, and I reckon we&#x27;d be up to $10,000 a week now,&quot; Karen says.</p><img data-id="90191908-4213-48df-8eb3-673d26f157ba" src="https://prod.static9.net.au/fs/90191908-4213-48df-8eb3-673d26f157ba" caption="The landscape is as striking as it is bleak." alt="" source="9News"  data-width="1280" data-height="960" fs="true" master-key="90191908-4213-48df-8eb3-673d26f157ba"/><p>That financial strain is hard to comprehend.

Frontier Services is a not-for-profit organisation that links 1200 volunteers with farms around Australia, placing them with families who need a helping hand.</p><p>The volunteer on Karen&#x27;s property is giving her something she never has â€“ more time.</p><p>&quot;The volunteer we have at the moment has been great. I&#x27;ve actually been able to get my book work done, pay some bills which you have to do,&quot; she says.</p><p>But asking for help is tough for these families - they are so used to doing everything for themselves. Another couple we met at Murgon, Robin and Monique Milne, were pushed to breaking point before they even contemplated reaching out.</p><img data-id="3db7c2cb-a0b8-4630-b9ad-9c3f6ff52d66" src="https://prod.static9.net.au/fs/3db7c2cb-a0b8-4630-b9ad-9c3f6ff52d66" caption="Robin and Monique Milne have found friendship and emotional support in the Hogan Bakers, who have been helping them out on the farm." alt="" source="9News"  data-width="1920" data-height="1080" fs="true" master-key="3db7c2cb-a0b8-4630-b9ad-9c3f6ff52d66"/><p>&quot;We were just so overwhelmed it was just so hard and someone said, &#x27;look get in touch with Frontier Services&#x27;.

But more than that, it&#x27;s a story of people and their strength. And that&#x27;s what will see them through until finally the heavens open.</p><p>&quot;I always say God made farmers to be custodions of his greatest creation and that&#x27;s what we are,&quot; Karen says.</p><p>&quot;I love my life, I love the animals so that&#x27;s why you do it. You do it for the love of it, the love the land, the love of the country.

However, the evidence for treating cancer in humans was still lacking.</p><p>&quot;We are in that odd situation where there are millions of people around the world who are using cannabis products to try and eradicate their cancer, but we basically don&#x27;t have one good quality clinical trial yet of medicinal cannabis and cancer for the purpose of actually getting rid of the cancer.</p><p>&quot;We are kind of waiting for these clinical trials to validate what we already know from studies in rats and mice and in cancer cells.&quot;</p><p>However, when it came to treating pain, induced vomiting from chemotherapy and quality of life for cancer patients, the benefits had been well documented, Prof. McGregor said.</p><p>&quot;If there is one thing the literature is telling us at the moment is that regardless of whether your cancer disappears, there seems to be an ability of medicinal cannabis to help with pain, help with appetite and also just help people come to terms with their condition and make them much more comfortable in life,&quot; he said.</p><p>When it came to how patients accessed medicinal cannabis, it appeared the vast majority of patients were still using illicit means, he said.</p><img data-id="0a4399a9-dd56-410c-addc-ea4e2e55ab1c" src="https://prod.static9.net.au/fs/0a4399a9-dd56-410c-addc-ea4e2e55ab1c" caption="Ms Burns will face court in January over the charges." alt="Ms Burns will face court in January over the charges." source="Supplied"  data-width="1396" data-height="785" fs="true" master-key="0a4399a9-dd56-410c-addc-ea4e2e55ab1c"/><p>In a 2019 survey conducted by The Lambert of 900 Australians with inflammatory bowel disease, 25 percent were using medicinal cannabis to self-medicate.
